## Description

This is a machine learning project that implements the core concepts of PCA and machine learning to classify musical tracks into genres. The dataset contains musical features and PCA is used for dimensionality reduction before applying classification models to predict the genre of each song.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks (for running the `.ipynb` file)
- Libraries used in the project:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `sklearn`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `seaborn`
    - `scipy`
    - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning models)

Use the following pip command to install these libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy
